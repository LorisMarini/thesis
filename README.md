## What
My PhD Thesis on quantum entanglement in atomically thick materials

## When
The University of Sydney 2014 - 2018

## Why
Because Physics is cool

## TLDR
One of the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics is the uncertainty principles. Basically, at the scale of small
isolate particles, it is not possible to simultaneously measure the position and the momentum of that particle (the same is
  true for time and speed). This is unless... one prepares a non-classical state via `quantum entanglement`. Why should we
  care? Knowing if we can accurately describe a particle like say a `photon`, we can use to do computations for us,
unleashing (at least in principle) the power of quantum computing. What I did for 4 years, was to take this to the
 extreme as I tried to generate these spooky states from a single layer of atoms. Sounds fun right? :D
