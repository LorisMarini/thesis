## What
My PhD Thesis on quantum entanglement in atomically thick materials at the University of Sydney 2014 - 2018

## Why
Because Physics is cool

## TL;DR
One of the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics is the uncertainty principles. Basically, at the scale of small
isolate particles, it is not possible to simultaneously measure the position and the momentum of that particle (the same is
  true for time and speed). This is unless... one prepares a non-classical state via `quantum entanglement`. Why should we
  care? If we know everything about a particle (say a `photon`) we can use it for quantum computing.
  What I did for 4 years, was to take this to the extreme as I tried to generate these spooky states from a single
  layer of atoms. Sounds fun right? :D

## A bit more

The trick is to generate pairs of energy-time entangled photons via a process called Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion.
Here energy-time means that both the energy and the generation time of the two photons are entangled. One photon (herald),
reveals the presence of the other (heralded) with a precision limited only by the measuring apparatus.
Repeat this for many times and the `heralded` photons can be used to process information (assuming that they are all
quantum-mechanically `identical`).
Photon pairs are typically generated from a second-order nonlinear interaction known as spontaneous parametric
downconversion (SPDC), or from a less-efficient third-order interaction through the process of spontaneous four-wave
mixing (SFWM). In all existing platforms, materials for SPDC play two roles: they provide the necessary optical
nonlinearity to generate down-converted fluorescent light, while ensuring that the fundamental and the down-converted
modes all propagate with the same group velocity (phase-matching). A limitation of this approach is that both the linear and nonlinear optical properties must be simultaneously engineered, often resulting in narrow-band and non-reconfigurable operation.

## The deal with 2D materials

2D materials promise to change this, thanks to their high nonlinearity, inherent broadband phase-matching, and highly configurable electro-optical properties. Although predicted in such thin crystals, to date SPDC has only been reported in structures with many millions of atoms, stimulating experimental efforts to validate its scaling laws in structures only a few atoms thick.

## Contributions to the field

In this thesis I looked at group IV transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), one of the most promising 2D materials for nonlinear optics, and describe efforts towards the experimental observation of non-resonant SPDC from a diffraction-limited area. Because of the intimate connection between the classical second-harmonic generation (SHG) and the quantum SPDC, the efficiency of one process provides insights on the other. This guided the design of single-photon coincidence measurements required to demonstrate the strong temporal correlations of these entangled states. Measurements are hindered by the presence of a broadband, temporally uncorrelated background, attributed to photoluminescence. This work improves the understanding of the nonlinear quantum optical potential of these crystals, and provides a performance benchmark for these ultra-thin materials.

It's a crazy idea, don't do it.
